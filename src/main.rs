// constants are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between 
// constants and variables. You aren't allowed to use mut w/ constants.

// A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: 
// integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize these from other programming languages.
